# ELISE

Recreation of the famous natural language processor ELIZA, originally written by Joseph Weizenbaum in MAD-SLIP. Input scripts are written using an updated format, and "Elise" is interacted with via terminal and API-synthesized speech output. Faithfully recreates the logic of the original down to the proprietary RNG functions -- given identical input, will perfectly emulate the example discussion as published by Joseph in his [1966 CACM article](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/365153.365168).
