    "0 I am 0 (* sad unhappy depressed sick) 0":
        wow, trauma-dumping much?
        I think deep down we're all a little %5.

    "0 I am 0 (* happy elated glad better) 0":
        that's great I'm so happy for you ☺

        =you
    "0 I am 0":
        %4, huh? congrats, I guess...?
        were you one of those kids who was just always %4?
        %4? are you sure that's normal?
        that's a mood.
    "0 I (* cant can't cannot) 0":
        I can't %4 either but you don't see me complaining, do you?

    "0 I feel 0":
        oh, we're talking about feelings now, okay.
        oh same, I feel %4 all the time lol
        do you enjoy feeling %4?
        does feeling %4 remind you of anything?
    "0 I 0 you 0":
        oh, wow, yikes.
        ummm did I hear that right? you want to %3 me?
        maybe you should worry about trying to %3 someone else first.
        go %3 yourself!
#    "I 0":
#        why does it matter that you $2?
#        I think you're oversharing a little, bestie...
#        why would you tell me that?
#        oh? you %2? does that make you feel important or something?

        I'm %4? well I think that you're %4, so there!
        why does it matter if I'm %4?
        maybe I am %4 -- it's really none of your business.
        wasn't this supposed to be about you? maybe you secretly want to be %4, how about that?
    "0 you 0 me":
        trust me, I don't %3 you, I swear.
        you like to think I %3 -- don't you?
        what gives you that impression?
        seriously, I %3 you? is that the best you could come up with?
        I bet you just wish that I %3 you.
        maybe I %3 you a little, so what?
        did someone else tell you that I %3 you? who?!
    "0 you 0":
        ummm I think you need to take a step back and stay in your own lane.
        your mom %3.
        projecting much?
        so what, do you feel better now that you've said that?

        do you have %4 issues or something?
        does your %5 remind you of anything else?
    "0 my 0":
        your %3?
        well at least you have that, right?
        are you a material girl? living in a material world?

can::
    "0 can you 0":
        %4? I don't really feel like it, sorry.
        =what
        why should I %4? why would I?
        maybe you should worry about whether you can %4 yourself.
    "0 can I 0":
        you can do anything you put your mind to! maybe not %4 though.
        have you always dreamed of %4?
        maybe you can go to one of those special bootcamps for %4.
        =what
        
what::
    "0":
        ummm, why do you ask?
        it's kind of weird that you want to know.
        what's your angle?
        are you obsessed with this topic or something?
        what answer do you expect?
        what do you really think?
        do you really believe there's an answer to that that would make you happy?
        do you usually ask people that?
        ummm, you go first! ☺

        is that the best excuse you could come up with?

        makes sense to me!
        
why::
    "0 why don't you 0":
        what makes you think I don't %5?
        I'll %5 on my own time -- when I want to.
        why don't you you %5 yourself?
        you want me to %5? wow. yikes...
        =what
    "0 why can't I 0":
        wait, do people normally %5?
        probably because you aren't able to %5?
        what, do you want me to teach you %5 or something?
